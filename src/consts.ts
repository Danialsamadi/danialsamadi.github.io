export const ABOUT_ME =
  `Full-stack developer and Computer Programming student at Algonquin College with a passion for building high-performance, user-centric applications. I specialize in creating scalable solutions that solve real-world problems—from processing 20,000+ configurations in 11 seconds with Go to building offline-first PWAs with cloud sync capabilities.

My approach combines systems-level thinking with modern web development, whether I'm optimizing memory management, building production-ready APIs, or crafting intuitive user experiences. I believe in writing clean, efficient code and contributing to the open-source community.`
