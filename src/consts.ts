export const ABOUT_ME =
  `My name is Danial Samadi, and I am a motivated Computer Programming student at Algonquin College with a strong interest in technology and programming. I have a keen interest in understanding how operating systems work, particularly Linux, which I am a big fan of due to its open-source nature.

In my free time, I enjoy creating Python scripts for automation and exploring new frameworks like Django. Learning about Linux and contributing to open-source projects are among my favorite activities.`
